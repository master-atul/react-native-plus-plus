# iOS build scripts / setup [WIP]

iOS builds via commandline are fairly much more complex as compared to android.


>**Note: Build works only for Mac users.** Since apple requires that all the build be made on xcode itself, iOS apps can only be built on a mac machine.


These are the few pre-requisites to build a release ipa file.
 - **BUILD_NAME** - The name that will be used by testers to identify the build, for example: '1.1.1', '1.0-alpha, etc.
 - **BUILD_NUMBER** - A unique integer number identifying the build. This is used by android to identify which build is the updated build. This should be a integer number. for example : 1, 111, 111, etc.
 - **IOS_APP_ID** - This is the unique app identifier which is used to identify the app uniquely in the app store or can be used to identify if the build is dev, pre prod or prod. These may look like these : com.app.notetaker-dev, com.app.notetaker-alpha.
 - **IOS_CERTIFICATE** - This is the certificate file used to sign the app.
 - **IOS_CERTIFICATE_KEY** - This is the certificate password used while creating the certificate.
 - **IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE** - This is provision profile needed to build the app. This file mentions the capabilities / devices that are allowed to run the app.
 - **IOS_EXPORT_OPTIONS_PLIST** - This is the options file needed to specify parameters for the build.
 - **IOS_SCHEME** - The scheme which should be used to build the ipa. Typically we will have different schemes per environment. For example: we can have local, preprod and a production scheme.
 - **IOS_CONFIGURATION** - This is the setting which specified if the build is DEBUG or RELEASE.
 - **PROJECT_NAME** - This is name of the project for example if your project name inside ios folder says SampleProject.xcworkspace or SampleProject.xcodeproj, then PROJECT_NAME=SampleProject .

### Release variants

Ideally every app has three release variants just like a typical backend application:
- Dev build - The app which connects to the staging/dev backend Environment. This can also have additional libraries like test fairy.
- Pre Prod build - The app which points to pre prod backend environment.This is usually very similar, if not identical to  production app.
- Prod build - The final ipa which should be released to the app store.

Hence, we would need three different `schemes` for three different variants.

A typical build process in iOS would have following steps:
1. Getting the certificates and provisioning profiles from apple developer account.
2. Adding the certificate to the default keychain and placing the provisioning profile at the location `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles/`
3. Archiving the project - Think of it as a executable zip of the project that can be run using XCode.
4. Exporting the IPA - Think of it as exporting the archive to a format recognised by the iPhone.

### Lets get started

1. Place the provisioning profile at `scripts/ios/profile/XYZ.mobileprovision`
2. Place the certificate at `scripts/ios/certs/ABC.p12`
3. Place an exportOptions file at `scripts/ios/exportOptions/exportOptions-dev.plist`
  Typically an exportOptions file looks like this :
  >scripts/ios/exportOptions/exportOptions-dev.plist

  ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>compileBitcode</key>
        <false/>
        <key>method</key>
        <string>enterprise</string>
        <key>teamID</key>
        <string>ABC1234DA</string>
        <key>uploadBitcode</key>
        <true/>
        <key>uploadSymbols</key>
        <true/>
        <key>manifest</key>
        <dict>
            <key>appURL</key>
            <string>null</string>
            <key>displayImageURL</key>
            <string>null</string>
            <key>fullSizeImageURL</key>
            <string>null</string>
        </dict>
    </dict>
    </plist>
  ```
  Make sure you put all the **above files** in the git ignore.

4. Create the script:
  The below script will create a new keychain `ios-build` and will store the certificate in the keychain. Also, it will make the keychain the default one so that the xcode picks up the certificate from the new keychain. Then it will copy the provisioning profile in the correct directory so that xcode picks it up.

  >scripts/ios/keychain.sh

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  set -e
  cur_dir=`dirname $0`

  #Check if ios-build keychain exists
  export keychainCount=`security list-keychains | grep -E 'ios-build' -c`

  if [ $keychainCount == 0 ] ; then
    echo "Create ios-build keychain"
    # Create a custom keychain
    security create-keychain -p "ios-build-password" ios-build.keychain
  fi
  # Add it to the list
  security list-keychains -d user -s ios-build.keychain

  echo "Making the ios-build keychain default ,so xcodebuild will use it for signing"
  security default-keychain -s ios-build.keychain

  echo "Unlocking the ios-build keychain"
  security unlock-keychain -p "ios-build-password" ios-build.keychain

  # Set keychain timeout to 1 hour for long builds
  # see http://www.egeek.me/2013/02/23/jenkins-and-xcode-user-interaction-is-not-allowed/
  security set-keychain-settings -t 3600 -l ~/Library/Keychains/ios-build.keychain

  echo "Importing $IOS_CERTIFICATE to keychain"
  security import $cur_dir/certs/$IOS_CERTIFICATE -k ~/Library/Keychains/ios-build.keychain -P $IOS_CERTIFICATE_KEY -T "/usr/bin/codesign" -A

  #Mac OS Sierra https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39868578/security-codesign-in-sierra-keychain-ignores-access-control-settings-and-ui-p
  security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple: -s -k "ios-build-password" ios-build.keychain

  # Put the provisioning profile in place
  echo "Coping $IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE in place"
  mkdir -p ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles
  cp "$cur_dir/profile/$IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE" ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles/
  ```

5. Create the script that does the build.
  This script will run the xcodebuild to first archive the project. Then it will generate the IPA file that can be used for installing the app onto an iPhone.
  >scripts/ios/builder.sh

  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash

  set -e
  cur_dir=`dirname $0`

  WORKING_DIR=`pwd`;
  cd $cur_dir/../../ios
  echo "Setting version to ${BUILD_NUMBER}, ${BUILD_NAME}"
  xcrun agvtool new-version -all ${BUILD_NUMBER}
  xcrun agvtool new-marketing-version ${BUILD_NAME}
  cd $WORKING_DIR

  echo "Archiving the project"
  xcodebuild clean archive PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=${IOS_APP_ID} -project $cur_dir/../../ios/${PROJECT_NAME}.xcodeproj -scheme $IOS_SCHEME -configuration $IOS_CONFIGURATION -derivedDataPath $cur_dir/../../ios/build -archivePath $cur_dir/../../ios/build/Products/${PROJECT_NAME}.xcarchive

  # or if you are not using xcodeproj and are using xcworkspace to build.. use the below code:

  # echo "Archiving the project"
  # xcodebuild clean archive PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=${IOS_APP_ID} -workspace $cur_dir/../../ios/${PROJECT_NAME}.xcworkspace -scheme $IOS_SCHEME -configuration $IOS_CONFIGURATION -derivedDataPath $cur_dir/../../ios/build -archivePath $cur_dir/../../ios/build/Products/${PROJECT_NAME}.xcarchive

  #SIGN
  # Issue : "No applicable devices found."
  # Fix: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39634404/xcodebuild-exportarchive-no-applicable-devices-found
  unset GEM_HOME
  unset GEM_PATH

  echo "Export archive to create IPA file using $IOS_EXPORT_OPTIONS_PLIST"
  xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath $cur_dir/../../ios/build/Products/${PROJECT_NAME}.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist $cur_dir/../../scripts/ios/exportOptions/$IOS_EXPORT_OPTIONS_PLIST -exportPath $cur_dir/../../ios/build/Products/IPA

  echo "IPA will be found at $cur_dir/../../ios/build/Products/IPA/$IOS_SCHEME.ipa"
  ```

### Executing the scripts
1. Run the `keychain.sh` to setup the certificate and provision profile like this:
`IOS_CERTIFICATE='ABC.p12' IOS_CERTIFICATE_KEY='PASSWORD' IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE='ABC.mobileprovision' sh scripts/ios/keychain.sh`

2. Now, run the build script to build the ipa file like this:
 `PROJECT_NAME='NoteTaker' IOS_APP_ID='com.notetaker.app.ios' BUILD_NUMBER=11 BUILD_NAME=1.1.1 IOS_SCHEME='local' IOS_CONFIGURATION='RELEASE' IOS_EXPORT_OPTIONS_PLIST='exportOptions-dev.plist' sh ./scripts/ios/builder.sh`


The build should take couple of minutes and you can find the final ipa file at:
`ios/build/Products/IPA/`
