#### Why not cordova

1. App runs inside a webview - slower in response
2. In experience , we spend more time fixing version specific issues .. like oh it works in andorid 5 but not in 4.4 etc

#### Why not native ?

Need to maintain multiple code bases for multiple platforms  
Inconsistent APIs in multiple platforms  
With react native learn once write on both platforms.  
Same dev team for both IOS and android  
Lot of code is shared - saves time and cost
