# Eslint: The guardian of code conventions ⚔️

**Eslint** is a tool that allows to maintain code quality and enforce code conventions. Eslint is a static code evaluator. Basically, it means that eslint will not actually run the code but will instead read through the source code to see if all the pre - configured code conventions are followed by the developers.

>Eslint allows to maintain consistent code style throughout the project. Thus, any developer of the team can easily understand the code written by another developer. This can exponentially increase the teams velocity and avoid dependencies. It can prevent human errors and can act as a guardian that maintains code conventions.

### Examples
Apart from code conventions , eslint also spots common mistakes  made by developers. For example,

```js
var a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, e = 4;

var test = function() {
console.log(a, b, c, d, e);
};
```

The above code will compile fine. But as soon as u run it , it will throw a runtime exception`ReferenceError`

```js
test()

VM206:4 Uncaught ReferenceError: d is not defined
    at test (<anonymous>:4:22)
    at <anonymous>:1:1
test @ VM206:4
(anonymous) @ VM222:1
```

These mistakes can be easily detected by eslint.

### Installation

It is pretty easy to setup eslint for a project.

```
yarn add --dev eslint babel-eslint eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-native
```

This would install eslint and other useful plugins as your dev dependencies.

And then in your `package.json` add a `npm script` as below.

So now your `package.json` should have

```js
{
  "name": "testapp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start",
    ....
    ....
    ....
     "lint": "eslint app/",
     "lint:fix": "eslint app/ --fix"
  },
  "dependencies": {
  ....
  ....
```


Now you can simply run

```
npm run lint
or
npm run lint:fix
```

`npm run lint` will just run the eslint and show a list of errors that need to be fixed.`npm run lint:fix` will run eslint and attempt to correct the errors it is able to fix automatically.


## Icing on the cake

Most modern editors have support for **eslint **via plugins.  The benefit of a text editor eslint plugin is that these plugins suggest correction while we write code itself thus saving a lot of time for the developer.

A editor configured with eslint would look something like this.

<br>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/6/6.1/eslint-error-editor.png" style="width: 100%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
</div>
<br>

Also, some of these plugins also support features like **lint on save.**  Thus, eslint attempts to run`eslint --fix <current_file>` This fixes all auto fixable lint errors such as incorrect indentation spaces, etc the moment you  hit save `(cmd+s)` on a file.

<br>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/6/6.1/eslint-atom.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
  <img src="/assets/images/6/6.1/atom-eslint-config.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
</div>
<br>

We **strongly** recommend to enable this feature.

## The `.eslintrc` file

**Eslint** rules can be configured via a configuration file `.eslintrc` which should be placed in the root directory of the project.

A sample `.eslintrc` file looks like this :

```js
# "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
# "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning(doesn’ t affect exit code)
# "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error(exit code is 1 when triggered)
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  },
  "plugins": [
    "react",
    "react-native"
  ],
  "ecmaFeatures": {
    "jsx": true
  },
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "react/no-did-mount-set-state": 2,
    "react/no-direct-mutation-state": 2,
    "react/jsx-uses-vars": 2,
    "no-undef": 2,
    "semi": 2,
    "react/prop-types": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-bind": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": 2,
    ....
    ....
    ....
  },
  "globals": {
    "GLOBAL": false,
    "it": false,
    "expect": false,
    "describe": false,
    ....
    ....
    ....
   }
}
```

The important area in the above configuration is the rules section. This section controls all the code conventions followed in the project.

Complete list of all the available rules are present here:  [http://eslint.org/docs/rules/](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)

It can be pretty overwhelming at first to decide which rules should go in. Hence we can start with

```js
"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"]
```

These should cover all the basic rules needed.

But we recommend you add these also

```js
"rules": {
    "react/no-did-mount-set-state": 2,
    "react/no-direct-mutation-state": 2,
    "react/jsx-uses-vars": 2,
    "no-undef": 2,
    "semi": 2,
    "react/prop-types": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-bind": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": 2,
    ....
    ....
    ....
  },
```

Rest of the rules can be added based on what conventions the team decides to follow  in the project.


## Recommendations

A suggestion would be that we add more of auto-fixable rules as the corrections suggested by these rules can be auto fixed by the editor with eslint plugin while saving the file itself. This would reduce the time that a developer would spend fixing lint than writing actual code.

Also  we recommend  using eslint for spacing/tabs instead of other methods like`.editorconfig`. This way, all the code conventions can be configured via single utility **\(eslint\)**. Also, indentations and spacing can be auto fixed by the editor itself with auto fix on save.
