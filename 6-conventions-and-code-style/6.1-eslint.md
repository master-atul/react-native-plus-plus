## Eslint: The guardian of code conventions ⚔️

Every team composes of developers who follow different conventions. Hence, often we find that code written by a developer is not easily understood by another developer in the same team. This creates dependencies on individuals and tight dependencies in a software development project can affect the velocity of the team.

The best way to solve this is by deciding and following code conventions.

> We strongly believe that NO convention is bad.
>
> As long as there is some convention and it is followed relegiously,  its good.

Code conventions can be as easy as following 4 spaces instead of tabs, or ending a statement always with semicolon, etc. It could also be something more complex like not allowing `setState()`to be invoked on `componentWillMount`of a React Component.

**Eslint** is a tool that allows to maintain code quality and enforce code conventions. Eslint is a static code evaluator. Basically, it means that eslint will not actually run the code but will instead read through the source code to see if all the pre - configured code conventions are followed by the developers.

Eslint allows to maintain consistent code style throughout the project. Thus, any developer of the team can easily understand the code written by another developer. This can exponentially increase the teams velocity and avoid dependencies.

Apart from code conventions , eslint also spots common mistakes  made by developers. For example,

```js
var a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, e = 4;

var test = function() {
console.log(a, b, c, d, e);
};
```

The above code will compile fine. But as soon as u run it , it will throw a runtime exception`ReferenceError`

```js
test()

VM206:4 Uncaught ReferenceError: d is not defined
    at test (<anonymous>:4:22)
    at <anonymous>:1:1
test @ VM206:4
(anonymous) @ VM222:1
```

These mistakes can be easily detected by eslint.

It is pretty easy to setup eslint for a project.

```
yarn add --dev eslint
```

This would install eslint as your dev dependency.

And then in your `package.json` add a `npm script` as below.

So now your `package.json` should have

```js
{
  "name": "testapp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start",
    ....
    ....
    ....
     "lint": "eslint app/",
     "lint:fix": "eslint app/ --fix"
  },
  "dependencies": {
  ....
  ....
```

Now you can simply run

```
npm run lint
or 
npm run lint:fix
```

`npm run lint` will just run the eslint and show a list of errors that need to be fixed.`npm run lint:fix` will run eslint and attempt to correct the errors it is able to fix automatically.

Now, for the icing on the cake, most modern editors have support for **eslint **via plugins.  The benefit of a text editor eslint plugin is that these plugins suggest correction while we write code itself thus saving a lot of time for the developer.

A editor configured with eslint would look something like this.

Also, some of these plugins also support features like **lint on save.**  Thus, eslint attempts to run`eslint --fix <current_file>` This fixes all auto fixable lint errors such as incorrect indentation spaces, etc the moment you  hit save `(cmd+s)` on a file.

We **strongly** recommend to enable this feature.

**Eslint** rules can be configured via a configuration file `.eslintrc` which should be placed in the root directory of the project.

A sample `.eslintrc` file looks like this :

```js
# "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
# "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning(doesn’ t affect exit code)
# "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error(exit code is 1 when triggered)
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  },
  "plugins": [
    "react",
    "react-native"
  ],
  "ecmaFeatures": {
    "jsx": true
  },
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "react/no-did-mount-set-state": 2,
    "react/no-direct-mutation-state": 2,
    "react/jsx-uses-vars": 2,
    "no-undef": 2,
    "semi": 2,
    "react/prop-types": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-bind": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": 2,
    ....
    ....
    ....
  },
  "globals": {
    "GLOBAL": false,
    "it": false,
    "expect": false,
    "describe": false,
    ....
    ....
    ....
   }
}
```

The important area in the above configuration is the rules section. This section controls all the code conventions followed in the project.

Complete list of all the available rules are present here:  [http://eslint.org/docs/rules/](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)

It can be pretty overwhelming at first to decide which rules should go in. Hence we can start with

```js
"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"]
```

These should cover all the basic rules needed.

But we recomment you add these also

```js
"rules": {
    "react/no-did-mount-set-state": 2,
    "react/no-direct-mutation-state": 2,
    "react/jsx-uses-vars": 2,
    "no-undef": 2,
    "semi": 2,
    "react/prop-types": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-bind": 2,
    "react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": 2,
    ....
    ....
    ....
  },
```

Rest of the rules can be added based on what conventions the team decides to follow  in the project.

A suggestion would be that we add more of auto-fixable rules as the corrections suggested by these rules can be auto fixed by the editor with eslint plugin while saving the file itself. This would reduce the time that a developer would spend fixing lint than writing actual code.

Also  we recommend  using eslint for spacing/tabs instead of other methods like`.editorconfig`. This way, all the code conventions can be configured via single utility **\(eslint\)**. Also, indentations and spacing can be auto fixed by the editor itself with auto fix on save.

Eslint if configured properly can increase the productivity of team exponentially while maintaing code quality. It can prevent human errors and can act as a guardian that maintains code conventions.
