# Environment variables

Since react-native is combines native platform code with JS, you might find it hard to accomplish small tasks like passing environment variables. But don't worry, we got you covered here as well ðŸ™Œ

### How Environment variables work in react-native?

Since the JS code is being executed by the native platform, we cannot directly pass env variables like we used to do in node/web pack projects. So we found an alternative way to accomplish this.

### How to use Environment variables in RN?
We created an `env.config.js` file which exports an object. The env object can contain the API base url, environment, and even the app fixtures/mock api data, etc (we will discuss this in details in [API mocks](./6.5-axios-and-api-mocks.md) section). And on the CI (travis in our case), we change the contents of the file depending on the build type(Dev, UAT or Prod). Sounds cool right? ðŸ¤“

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/6/6.3/env-structure.png" style="width: 50%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
</div>
<br>

The app will contain all the env configs inside `environment/` folder. The CI will replace the contents of `env.config.js` with `environment/prod.config.js` before starting the build process.

### How to change env config using TravisCI?

The command is pretty simple. All we need to do is copy the contents from one file to another.
```shell
cp app/config/env/prod.env.js app/config/env.config.js
```
Head over to [TravisCI]() chapter to know how and where to put the above mentioned command.
