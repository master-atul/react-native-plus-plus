## Using React-navigation
Using react-navigation is pretty simple once you understand how it works. Unfortunately, their official documentation lacks some explanations. But no need to worry, we will try to fill the gaps in the official documentation in this chapter.

## How navigation happens in native applications?
When it comes to native apps, the routing is a little different, specially for those who are coming from a WEB development background. There is the concept of stack, screen, etc.

### What is a stack in navigation?
We all have heard of stacks in our college programming classes. Well, this stack is exactly that. Whenever you navigate from one screen to another, the new screen comes on top. The old screen is still there(unless you reset your stack). This mechanism of caching the old pages helps improving performance and making the transitions smoother. Have a look at the below image for example of stack in navigation.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10/stack.svg" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
</div>

## Types of navigators offered by react-navigation
React-navigation offers a bunch of navigators predefined for our use. An app might contain all the three navigators. Lets try to understand all of them one-by-one.

- Stack-navigator: This is most common navigator of all. You will use it for most of the applications. We just explained how stack works in navigation. You define stack navigator by passing the routes object inside StackNavigator function from react-navigation. Each of the screen gets mounted only when you navigate to that particular screen and gets un-mounted only when you go back or manually reset the navigation state.

- Tab-navigator: This is also quite common user interface. Where we have a bunch of tabs and we can swipe between them. We have seen this is facebook, twitter and many other famous apps. react-navigation supports this navigator as well out of the box. The way of defining is pretty much same as of stack-navigator. Only difference is that the routes you define in Tab-navigator gets mounted all at once. So you need to be a little careful when you manage navigating-to/coming from different stack.

- DrawerNavigator: //TODO

## Creating a router

Install `react-navigation` using NPM or Yarn.

`yarn add react-navigation` or `npm install react-navigation --save`

Creating a router is pretty easy, you just define a page component(which will be container component) and then import in your router.js file.

Each of the navigators accept an object while initialization whose syntax is as follows:

```js
const Router = StackNavigator({
  <routeName, string>: {screen: <screenObject, enum(React component, navigator instance)>, navigationOptions: <Screen level nav options>}
}, {
  navigationOptions: <Router level default nav options>
})
```

`routeName`is the name associated with the current scteen. It will be used for navigation/analytics tracking.

`screenObject` The screen key in the router object can take:
- A react native component.
- An react-navigation router instance if you want routers nesting. [Nesting of routers](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/nesting)

> Example router.js

```js
import {StackNavigator} from 'react-navigation';
import HomePage from '../pages/Home.page';
import AboutPage from '../pages/About.page';

const Router = StackNavigator({
  home: {screen: HomePage,
    navigationOptions: {
      title: 'Start taking notes',
    }
  },
  about: {
    screen: AboutPage
  }
}, {
  mode: 'card'
});

export default Router;

```

Each of the navigator returns a react component which is supposed to be added to the root level of the app.

> Example App.container.js

````js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import Router from './routes';
import {connect} from 'react-redux';

class App extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Router />
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```


When we define a react component in our router file, it adds few properties to the component, which are:

- static [navigationOptions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/navigation-options#Stack-Navigation-Options): We can use this to define our headers, title, etc. However we recommend defining this in router.js because we will be importing page to our router and defining header UI/title in the container component is not a good idea.

- this.props.navigation: react-navigation also adds navigation function to the screen. This function can be used to navigate to a route or pass parameters. We do not recommend this way as we will be handling routing via [redux-actions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/guides/redux)
