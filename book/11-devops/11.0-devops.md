# DevOps

Whenever we start a new project, after setting up the boilerplate, best practices suggest that we setup the continuous deployment so that the rest of the team could easily trigger and receive test builds of the latest app code.
This way the testing team can easily receive the test builds without continuously bugging the developers.

Few basic requirements for a good devOps setup can be:

- Lint and tests with coverage should run whenever a pull request is raised.
- Every time we merge our changes to the  master branch we want the CI process to build the code, run lint and tests, and then build and publish apps to be distributed to the internal team testers.
- Each test build must have the a version and build number and it must be same on both Android and IOS for each version of code.
- An email should be sent out to all testers when a new build is available.
- Developers should also have the option to manually build on local machine quickly.
- Ability to pass environment vairables to the scripts so that we can generate different builds for staging, preprod and production.

The following chapters would show step by step on how to achieve these.
