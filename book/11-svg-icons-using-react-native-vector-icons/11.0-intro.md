# Icons in react-native

Those who come from web development background knows the power of svg icons. We always prefer svg\(for icons, images\) and what not. Benefits of SVGs are:

* They are resolution independent\(scalable\)
* They provide you more flexibility in changing color etc.
* They are lesser in size as compared to an image.
* They are written in XML syntax so you can put directly inside your html without worrying about bundling your assets.

### That was about web, does react-native support SVGs?

Unfortunately, rendering SVGs in native is not as simple as it is in HTML/WEB, where you can just use SVG as image IMG or copy paste svg content inside your HTML. Unlike web, react-native doesn't support SVGs out of the box. Though there are some plugins which lets you render SVGs, but they do not support all SVG elements and it is not very easy to use.

### How do you get the power of SVG in native environment?

Let me introduce you to this amazing library called \[react-native-vector-icons\]\([https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons%29%29%29\). It comes bundled with a bunch of icon sets\(default is [`FontAwesome`](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)\).

* All the fonts are scalable and you can style them just like SVGs.
* It returns a react component which accepts name, etc. as prop. After integration, the usage will be as simple as `<Icon name="rocket" size={30} color="#900" />`
* You can pass custom style.
* It also supports a couple of other components which might be useful. Ex, Button with an icon \(`<Icon.Button />`\)
* You can also create your own iconset if you want to use custom icons.
* Installation is a 2 step process if you wish to use the icons provided by FontAwesome or other similar font libraries. (yarn add and react-native link)
* If you wish to use custom fonts(made in svg), please read the next chapter.
