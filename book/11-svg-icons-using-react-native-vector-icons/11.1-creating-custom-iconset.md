## Creating custom iconset

`react-native-vector-icons` support using custom icon sets if you do not want to use the icons which come bundled or if you want to add your own icons. It supports Fontello and IcoMoon to create custom fonts. We used icomoon to convert our svgs to a config which is readable by the library.

### Configuring your project to support custom iconsets.

The steps for the same are as follows:

* Create a resources folder where we will keep our custom fontfile(.ttf).

* Add this line in package.json: `"rnpm": { "assets": [ "resources/fonts" ] },`

* Do `react-native link`. This will copy your fontfiles to android and iOS resources folders.

That's it, you are done with the setup. Now we need to get the ttf file and place it inside the `resources/fonts` that we just created.

### How to generate .ttf fonts using icomoon:

* Open the [iconmoon application.](https://icomoon.io/app)

* Remove the current set and create a new empty set.

* Drag and drop your svg files on the tool.

* Select the files which you want to export. Select all if you want to export all the icons. After the selection, click generate font. This will download a zip file on your system.

* The zip file will contain a selection.json file fonts folder containing a .ttf file. We only need these two files to use fonts in react-native.

//TODO: Add screenshot

* Put the JSON file (selection.json) in your app and create a file called CustomIcon.js and import the config.json which you exported in the previous step.

```js
import {createIconSetFromIcoMoon} from 'react-native-vector-icons';
import icoMoonConfig from './config.json';
export default createIconSetFromIcoMoon(icoMoonConfig);
```

* Paste the .ttf file found inside the fonts folder in the downloaded zip to
  * For Android: `<projectRoot>/android/app/src/main/assets/fonts/`
  * For iOS: `<projectRoot>/ios/`

* That's it, to use a font simply import the file as a react component and pass the icon name and size(optional) or even style.

```js
import CustomIcon from './components/CustomIcon.js'

<CustomIcon name='android' /> //To use the icon
<CustomIcon name='android' size={25} /> // To pass size
<CustomIcon name='android' style={styles.androidIcon} /> // To pass custom tyle
```
