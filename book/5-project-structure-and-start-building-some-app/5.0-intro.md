# Project structure

To create a new project run `react-native init <project-name>`. Example: `react-native init myproject`.
We will use this project as our base in this book.
Once the project setup is complete you should have a project structure similar to this.

```
.
├── .babelrc
├── .buckconfig
├── .flowconfig
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
├── .watchmanconfig
├── android
├── ios
├── node_modules
├── __tests__
│   ├── index.android.js
│   └── index.ios.js
├── app.json
├── index.android.js
├── index.ios.js
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

Firsty, lets run the project to see how it looks.

Type the command

`react-native run-ios` - for running the app on iOS simulator

or

`react-native run-android` - for running the app on a connected android phone /emulator.

Note that for `react-native run-android` to work, you should have an open android emulator or an android device with USB Debugging enabled connected to your laptop via a USB cable.

If all goes well you should see the following screen on iOS or android emulator.

<br>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/5/5.0/5.0-myproject-ios.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;" hspace="40">
  <img src="/assets/images/5/5.0/5.0-myproject-android.png" style="width: 40%;display: inline-block;">
</div>
<br>

If you noticed there are two entry point files `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js`.
Hence, when we run the command `react-native run-ios` the file `index.ios.js` serves as our entry point.

Under the hood, when we run the command `react-native run-ios`, first the iOS native project inside `ios` directory is compiled. Along with the native project react-native packager kicks in on another terminal window and runs on port `8081` by default. The packager is responsible for compilation of javascript code to a js bundle file. When the native project is successfully launched on the simulator, it asks the packager for the bundle file to load. Then all the instructions inside the js code is run to successfully launch the app.


The code used for this chapter can be found on the **branch** `chapter/5/5.0`.
